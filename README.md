Well, Hello there! You found my website.

As of November 12th, 2021, I'm currently learning some HTML, CSS and JS by trying to build my own website. It's pretty barebones right now.

My name's Nguyen! Nice to meet you! It's a bit hard to pronounce for most of you, but it's ok!
Here's my attempt at a guide: ng, as in sing, thing, fling, etc. + wuh + ee + uh + n

Anyways, here's the website: [ngtr6788.github.io](ngtr6788.github.io)
